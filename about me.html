<font size="5" color="#ae7ea2">
A teenager who swears revenge on enormous 
man-eating humanoid creatures known as Titans, who have forced 
what remains of the human race to live in walled off cities and 
devoured my mother while destroying my home town in the Shiganshina 
district of Wall Maria. In order to defeat the Titans, I enlisted in 
the Military and joined the Survey Corps.
My journey started from there, and since then I'm moving forward and 
will keep doing so.</font>
